Wolfie's UK Trains
========================================

An addon for Timberwolf's UK Trains with mostly random
stuff that I thought would look good and enhance the vibe.

Some of the content is to fill little gaps in the set,
some of it is just for fun.

* Some new multiple unit options
* Low-capacity long-distance vehicles (sleeping cars)
* A varied set of covered hoppers
* A few silly concepts that can be disabled
  (if they're too overpowered for you...)


Requires Timberwolf's Trains to be installed and
active.

This is RATHER DERIVATIVE and I don't want to take any
credit for the great work Timberwolf has done with
his set, which keeps me coming back for more OpenTTD
year-on-year. At first this was an experiment to see
what could be done with some quick kitbashing,
but it turns out making stuff is and carrying
on after doing a bit of setup was natural.

Timberwolf built a great pipeline here and his set is an
inspiration.
